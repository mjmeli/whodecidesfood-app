# Mock API
Contained within this folder is a mock API intended for easy use during front-end development, without having to setup the real API backend.

**This API is not fully featured, performant, nor remotely close to secure, and should not be used in a production system.** In end-to-end development testing, you should use the true backend API.

This mock API is developed in `Express.js`. It is very close to being fully featured, but a few features that would be necessary for a production API are missing as shortcuts (e.g. proper security).
